    """
    Slice-and-simplify one HLIL instruction with msynth and drop the
    result as a user comment.

    Workflow
    --------
    1. Backward slice (single BB) –  
       `backward_slice_basic_block_level` resolves the instruction’s SSA
       dependency chain and translates the fully-inlined expression to
       Miasm IR.
    2. MBA simplification –  
       The cached simplifier canonicalises the Mixed-
       Boolean Arithmetic (MBA) expression.
    3. Annotate –  
       The simplified expression is attached as a decompiler comment at the
       instruction’s address.

    Error handling
    --------------
    * Any failure in translation or simplification is caught locally.  
    * A concise red line appears in Binary Ninja’s log; the full traceback
      is available when *Debug Log* is enabled.  
    * The function then returns early, leaving no partial comment behind.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bv :
        The active :class:`BinaryView`; needed only for architecture
        pointer-size information inside the slice routine.
    instruction :
        The HLIL instruction currently selected by the user.

    Side effects
    ------------
    * On success, a comment is written into
      ``instruction.function.source_function`` at `instruction.address`.
    * No value is returned; caller need not inspect a result.

def inline_functions_recursively(bv: BinaryView, start_func: Function, max_depth: int = 0) -> None:
    """
    Recursively inline every function that is reachable from `start_func`
    so the decompiler can run a true cross-function analysis on a single,
    fully inlined intermediate language.  The routine sets
    `Function.inline_during_analysis = True` for all descendants in an
    order that forces Binary Ninja to do *exactly one* global analysis
    pass.

    Efficiency highlights
    ---------------------
    - All descendants are discovered, including self- and mutually
      recursive functions.
    - Strongly-connected components (SCCs) are collapsed, so every
      recursion group is handled as a single unit.
    - Analysis is paused while the flags are flipped, eliminating the
      overhead of spawning one job per function.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    1. Pause auto analysis
    2. Build the complete call graph rooted at `start_func`.
    3. Find strongly-connected components (SCCs) so that every recursion
       group is handled as a single unit.
    4. Collapse SCCs to get the condensation DAG (always acyclic).
    5. Topologically sort the DAG (caller before callee) and iterate it in
       reverse order to obtain a bottom-up sequence (callee before caller).
    6. For each SCC in that order, set `inline_during_analysis = True` on all
       member functions that are not flagged as `thunk`. If `max_depth > 0`,
       only do this for SCCs whose **minimum member distance from `start_func`
       in the original call-graph** is in [1..max_depth]. The root SCC
       (distance 0) is never inlined here.
    7. Resume analysis and invoke `BinaryView.update_analysis_and_wait()` so
       that the core processes the queued work once.

    Complexity
    ----------
    - SCC computation           : O(V + E)
    - Condensation + topo sort  : O(V + E)
    - Flagging loop             : O(V)
      ------------------------------------
      Total                     : O(V + E)

    Parameter
    ---------
    max_depth : int = 0
        0  : unlimited (original behavior: inline full transitive closure)
        >0 : only inline SCCs whose **minimum member distance** from `start_func`
              in the original call-graph lies in [1..N] (root SCC at 0 excluded).
