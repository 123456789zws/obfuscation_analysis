def build_call_graph_from_function(root_func: Function) -> DiGraph:
    """
    Construct a *complete* directed call‑graph that contains **every** function
    that can be reached—directly or indirectly—from the given `root_func`.

    Fundamental ideas
    ------------------
      * Depth‑first search (implemented with an explicit stack) is used to avoid
        Python’s recursion‑depth limits on large binaries.
      * Each function is visited once; therefore the procedure is Θ(V+E) where
        V := number of functions and E := number of call‑edges.
      * We always `add_node` *before* exploring callees so that leaf functions
        (those without outgoing edges) are still present in the graph.

    Returns
    --------
      A `networkx.DiGraph` whose
          nodes  = Binary Ninja `Function` objects
          edges  = calls  (caller -> callee)

    ------
    Function
        Each function that appears to contain undefined or overlapping

    Return **True** if *func* appears to have *broken* disassembly.

    A function is flagged when **any** of the following hold:

    1. In LLIL form the basic block’s terminator is `LLIL_UNDEF`.
    2. In linear disassembly view a basic block is either
       * empty,
       * marked by Binary Ninja as `has_invalid_instructions`,

    obfuscated or partially decoded functions.
